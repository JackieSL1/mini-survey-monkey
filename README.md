## Scope
*As stated in the project description.*
* Surveyor can create a survey with a list of Questions.
* Questions can be open-ended (text), asking for a number within a range, or asking to choose among many options.  
* Users fill out a survey that is a form generated based on the type of questions in the survey.
* Surveyor can close the survey whenever they want (thus not letting in new users to fill out the survey), and at that point a survey result is generated, compiling the answers: for open-ended questions, the answers are just listed as-is, for number questions a histogram of the answers is generated, for choice questions a pie chart is generated
